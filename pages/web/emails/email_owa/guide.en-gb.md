### 2. Understand the webmail display.

Once you have logged in to OWA webmail, you will see that there are several sections to the interface. You can use the table and the image below to familiarise yourself with it.

|Parts|Description|  
|---|---|  
|Top section (1)|Contains two tab bars. The first can be used to manage the general settings (such as accessing options), and the second can be used to perform specific actions with your address (such as sending or replying to emails).|  
|Left-hand side (2)|Displays the list of folders for your email address. These appear as a tree-view that you can expand or hide.|
|Central section (3)|Displays a list of messages (read or unread) from the folder selected in the left-hand side. This section can also display search results.|
|Right-hand side (4)|Displays the preview pane when an email has been selected.|

### 3. View emails.

To view your emails, click on a folder on the left-hand side. By default, the emails you receive will arrive in the "Inbox" folder. To see if you have received any new emails, check if a number appears next to a folder.

To view an email, click on a folder. The emails contained in the folder are displayed in the centre section. Unread messages appear in a different colour, so that you can tell them apart from messages that have been read.

## Objective

If you need to configure a failover IP address on your instances because:

- you have multiple websites on your instance 
- you host international projects
- you want to migrate from a Dedicated Server to a Public Cloud instance

... you can import a failover IP address that is linked to a different OVH service.

**This guide explains how to import this failover IP into your OVH Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

* access to the [OVH Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}
* a [failover IP address](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/ip_failover.xml){.external} assigned to an [OVH Dedicated Server](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/){.external}.

## Instructions

Firstly, log in to the [OVH Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} and click the `Cloud`{.action} menu. Then click the `Servers`{.action} side-menu to expand your list of projects.

When you've found your project in the list, click it and then select the `Infrastructure`{.action} tab.

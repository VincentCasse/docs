## Introduction
If you want to move your objects from one datacentre to another, or even from one project to another, syncing objects between containers is the best solution for avoiding service disruptions during your migration. This guide explains how you can implement this solution.


### Requirements
- an environment that is ready to use the OpenStack API with the Swift client
- OpenStack environment variables set
- two object containers in two different datacentres


## Configure the sync.

### Create a sync key.
For containers to authenticate, you will need to create a key and configure it on each object container.

- Create the key:


```bash
root@server-1:~$ sharedKey=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```


### Destination container configuration.
First of all, you will need to configure the key on the container that will receive the data. In our case, the destination container is in BHS1.

- Check the region that has loaded in the environment variables:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ env | grep OS_REGION

OS_REGION_NAME=BHS1
```

- Configure the key on the destination container:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift post --sync-key "$sharedKey" containerBHS
```

- Next, check that the key has been successfully configured using the following command, and note down the content of the "Account" variable at the same time:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift stat containerBHS
                         Account: AUTH_b3e269xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx2b0ba29
                       Container: containerBHS
                         Objects: 0
                           Bytes: 0
                        Read ACL:
                       Write ACL:
                         Sync To:
                        Sync Key: 4cA5j5LyaaG2ws32d1fsdQSxnvIJv+y2qFnbnm6Kw=
Meta Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.ovh.com
                   Accept-Ranges: bytes
                X-Storage-Policy: Policy-0
                      Connection: close
                     X-Timestamp: 1444812373.28095
                      X-Trans-Id: B2210C05:895E_9E45A961:01BB_561E52E1_16A3:5298
                    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

- Retrieve the target containerâ€™s address, then configure it on the source container (this one is: "//OVH_PUBLIC_CLOUD/Region/Account/Container")

```bash
root@server-1:~$ export destContainer="//OVH_PUBLIC_CLOUD/BHS1/AUTH_b3e269xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx2b0ba29/containerBHS"
```

### Source container configuration.
- Change the region in the environment variables:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ export OS_REGION_NAME=GRA1
```

- Configure the key on the source container:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift post --sync-key "$sharedKey" containerGRA
```

- Configure the recipient container on the source container:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift post --sync-to "$destContainer" containerGRA
```

- As detailed previously, you can check that it has been configured properly using the following command:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift stat containerGRA
         Account: AUTH_b3e269f057d14af594542d6312b0ba29
       Container: containerGRA
         Objects: 3
           Bytes: 15
        Read ACL:
       Write ACL:
         Sync To: //OVH_PUBLIC_CLOUD/BHS1/AUTH_b3e269xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx2b0ba29/containerBHS
        Sync Key: 4cA5j5LyaaG2wU4lDYnDmEwQSxnvIJv+y2qFnbnm6Kw=
   Accept-Ranges: bytes
      Connection: close
     X-Timestamp: 1444813114.55493
      X-Trans-Id: B2210C05:879E_052711B1:01BB_561E559B_24AE:6B1B
X-Storage-Policy: Policy-0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```



### Check the sync.
After a few minutes (depending on the number and size of the files to be sent), you can check whether the sync is successful by simply listing the files in each container.

- To list the files on the source container:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift list containerGRA
test1.txt
test2.txt
test3.txt
```

- To list the files on the destination container:

```bash
root@server-1:~$ swift list containerBHS
test1.txt
test2.txt
test3.txt
```

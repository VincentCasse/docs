This page explains how to configure user access to the Horizon interface: the canonical implementation of OpenStack's dashboard. Many features are only accessible through this interface.

- Enter a "User description"



## Note:
This description will be used so the user can be easily identified in the list created, but it is not a login name.

- Click "Create this user"

- Once the user has been created, keep the automatically generated password safe because you will not be able to recover this password later.


The list of users will then be displayed

The ID, descriptions and a series of three buttons for each user will appear here. These enable you to:

- Reset the password

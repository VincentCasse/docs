## Requirements

- access to the [OVH Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}


## Instructions

Click `Add user`{.action}, and choose a user description. The username and password are then generated automatically. Once the operation is complete, a message will open confirming that the account has been created.

The password will be visible in the Control Panel until you refresh the page. You can note down this password, and use it when you access the interface again. You can also generate a new password by clicking on the refresh icon, located next to your current password:

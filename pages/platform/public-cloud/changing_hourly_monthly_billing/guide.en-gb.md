## Objective

When you create a Public Cloud instance, you can choose to be billed at either an hourly or monthly rate. Hourly-rate instances are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, i.e. at the end of the month, users are billed for the specific resources they have utilised. Monthly-rate instances can be paid for in advance, and are billed at a lower price (50% less than pay-as-you-go). If you initially selected hourly billing, you can switch to monthly billing at any time.

**This guide explains how to switch from hourly to monthly billing.**

> [!warning]
>
> You cannot switch from monthly to hourly billing. If you would like to be billed at the hourly rate, you will need to delete your monthly-rate billing instance, create a new one, and select hourly billing.

## Requirements

- You must be logged in to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.


## Instructions

In the [Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, choose the instance you would like to change the billing rate for, and open its options menu. You will then be able to see the `Switch to monthly subscription`{.action} button:
